# Lab 4: Use SQL and PL/SQL features for JSON

## Introduction

As applications grow, the number of people that need to access and work with the data generated will grow as well. While the Node.js SODA APIs provide an easy way for app developers to start working with JSON data, not everyone will be comfortable working with Node.js or JSON.

In this lab, you will learn to use some of the SQL and PL/SQL functionality that has been added to Oracle Database to facilitate working with JSON data.
